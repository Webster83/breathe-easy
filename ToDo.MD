# To Do

## shq_upload.py

Finish docstrings for each function definition

## sd_copy.py

Add a card backup parameter that creates a full/delta backup of the card data.

## New modules / offshoot ideas

* Build a configuration generator support script
  * "if exists" check on launch of sleephq_uploader.py for config.yaml. If does not exist, call the config generator support script

* Look into possible "scriptability" of OSCAR importing, as some may wish to use both (or may not be SHQ pro members---though they should be!)

* RYO "magic uploader" with dual WIFI adapters. I could have built-in wifi be EzSh@re connected and the add-on wifi card be perma-connected to home wifi. Would love to work with SHQ devs on this idea, it would add extra cost to MU (MU ProPlus?), but open MU platform to be a host/server for other things
